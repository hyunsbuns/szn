Redo PLaterStatVC to work independently of the totals used to calculate stats on the szn and only move stat records into the totals once they are flagged for inclusion.

ResetPassword stuff....

//disabled bitcode in build settings

GameStatsSummaryTVC -> new ScrollGrid stuff

StatScrollGridVC - why add 40 to getHeight?  It works, but huh?


Fix stat total for GameStatVC and the stats page for the new way of doing stats for various sports

In RollCallVC toggle the button on when there is already a status found
In LocationPicker Pod, set searchBar to .Default

Fix HKKScrollGrid click to not show white...we currently have selection disabled

Fix Layout Problem on SZNVC - the top level stack view within the scroll view is not needed and is impeding on the layout.  right now we have a large number in there to accomodate testing.

For HKKVC -
    - how do we reload the scrollview to update the width of stuff?
    - how do we space the headers since they work differently?

Do we hit parse when pressing back on the PlayerStatsVC screen even if the did_attend is off or if changes were not made?

Make the team totals show up with correct values



Player stats in an event need a DID NOT PARTICIPATE switch for the sake of game averages. The switch will be defaulted to ON, which will set a value of 1 for a GAMES PLAYED stat and 0 if an admin turns the switch to off.

SeasonVC should be divided into SEASON and CAREER, where each will show leaders of each stat, totals and averages.

Events need a boolean for game or NOT A GAME for the sake of what stats are included in sums
Actually make the 3 screens that are sometimes readonly, readonly now that we have the seasons toggled correctly
Distinguish between what an admin can do and what a normal user can do

Deal with Roll Calls

BeforeRelease
-make sure a phone can be reset after a user had been auto logged in and the app works after we enable autologin

mainvc
-joined skwads arent showing, only created - NEED TO FIX

SeasonManagerVC TODO
-make adding a season only doable by a manager
-have that season impact the roster, stats, and schedule screens

Roster TODO
-rosters now work differently and need to be reconnected to the Roster table in parse

New Squad TODO
-creating a new squad should ask for the name of the initial season so there is guaranteed to be at least one


Calculate Stats for season across all events
